About
--------

The repo is about the implementations of GAN, DCGAN, Improved GAN, LAPGAN, and InfoGAN in PyTorch.

My presentation about GANs' recent development (at 2017.01.17): [Presentation slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HRNjCo_0PlspynoJKuoEF1AYkaKaUNgMzQ4nqiTlNUM/edit#slide=id.p)

Presented in the group meeting of Machine Discovery and Social Network Mining Lab, National Taiwan University.

Content
--------

- Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN): invented "adversarial nets" framework - a generative model G and a discriminative model D play a minimax two-player game.

- DC-GAN: proposed a set of constraints on the architectural topology of Convolutional GANs that make them stable to train in most settings.

- LAP-GAN: a cascade of generative models within a Laplacian pyramid framework to generate images in a coarse-to-fine fashion (high-resolution).

- Improved GAN (minibatch discrimination): allow the discriminator to look at multiple data examples in combination by incorporating the closeness between examples in a minibatch as side information.

- Info-GAN: an information-theoretic modification to the objective of Generative Adversarial Network that encourages it to learn interpretable and disentangled representations.
